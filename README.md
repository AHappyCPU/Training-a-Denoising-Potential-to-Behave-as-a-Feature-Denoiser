Denoising Potential Networks: A Novel Approach to Robust Feature Learning Through Energy-Based Models

\\

Overview
This project introduces Denoising Potential Networks (DPNs), a novel deep learning architecture that combines energy-based modeling with gradient-based feature refinement for robust image classification. The approach draws inspiration from physical systems and statistical mechanics, implementing a learnable potential function that guides feature representations toward optimal manifolds in the feature space.
From an energy-based perspective, DPNs introduce a fundamentally new way to think about feature learning in neural networks. Traditional deep learning architectures typically learn feature transformations through direct mappings, but DPNs instead learn an energy landscape that captures the underlying structure of valid feature configurations. This energy landscape, parameterized as a mixture of Gaussian components, defines a potential function whose local maxima correspond to stable, denoised feature representations.
The energy-based formulation provides several key theoretical advantages. First, it naturally handles uncertainty and noise in the input features by allowing them to evolve toward stable configurations through gradient ascent on the potential function. Second, the learned energy landscape provides an interpretable representation of the feature space structure, with the Gaussian components capturing local manifold geometry through their centers and precision matrices. Third, the iterative refinement process implemented through gradient ascent allows the model to actively denoise and improve feature representations, rather than relying on a single feed-forward pass.
This energy-based approach also connects the model to fundamental principles in statistical physics and dynamical systems theory. The gradient ascent dynamics can be interpreted as a discretized version of Langevin dynamics, providing a theoretical framework for analyzing the model's behavior. The mixture of Gaussians parameterization of the potential function relates to ideas from free energy minimization and variational inference, suggesting deeper connections to probabilistic modeling and statistical learning theory.

Technical Innovation
The core innovation lies in the formulation of a parameterized potential function φ(x) that shapes the feature space through a mixture of Gaussian components. Each component is characterized by its center μᵢ, precision matrix Σᵢ⁻¹, and weight wᵢ. The potential function is defined as:
φ(x) = log Σᵢ wᵢ exp(-1/2 (x-μᵢ)ᵀΣᵢ⁻¹(x-μᵢ))
This formulation allows the network to learn an energy landscape that captures the underlying structure of the data manifold. The architecture implements several key technical innovations:

Reparametrization of component weights using exponential transformation (wᵢ = exp(cᵢ)) to ensure positivity while maintaining stable gradients
Structured precision matrices through Cholesky-like decomposition (Σᵢ⁻¹ = AᵢᵀAᵢ) to guarantee positive definiteness
Iterative feature refinement through gradient ascent on the potential function
Learnable step size parameter for optimal convergence

Architecture Details
The full architecture consists of three phases:

Feature Extraction: A initial transformation of input data into a suitable feature space
Denoising Potential: The novel energy-based refinement module that iteratively improves feature representations
Classification: A final projection layer that maps refined features to class probabilities

The DenoisingPotential module implements the core algorithmic innovations, while the FullArchitecture class integrates all components into an end-to-end trainable system.

Implementation Features
The implementation includes several components:

Efficient computation of the potential function using the log-sum-exp trick for numerical stability
Automatic differentiation for computing gradients of the potential function
K-means initialization of component centers for better convergence
Comprehensive training pipeline with validation and visualization capabilities
Analysis tools for investigating the learned feature space and model behavior

Specifically, the DenoisingPotential class implements computational strategies to ensure numerical stability and efficient processing. The compute_potential method employs the log-sum-exp trick to prevent numerical overflow when computing the weighted sum of exponentials, a common challenge in mixture models. The implementation  manages the computation of quadratic terms using tensor operations through torch.einsum, avoiding explicit loops and maintaining batch processing capabilities.
The compute_gradient method leverages PyTorch's automatic differentiation while  managing the computation graph through strategic detachment and gradient enabling. This allows for stable higher-order derivatives necessary for the gradient ascent process while preventing memory leaks during the iterative refinement.
The forward method implements the gradient ascent process. It maintains a trajectory of intermediate states for analysis while implementing efficient batch processing of the entire feature refinement sequence. The implementation manages computational resources by detaching intermediate states after each iteration, preventing the accumulation of computational graphs that lead to memory overflow.
The FullArchitecture class introduces a novel initialization strategy through the initialize_centers method, which uses k-means clustering in the feature space to provide stable starting points for the Gaussian components. This initialization is crucial for training stability and faster convergence.
